Network Scan Report

Introduction:
This report provides a simplified explanation of the network scanning commands used, their results, and the security findings.
The goal is to help a non-technical person understand what was done and what it means.

1. Commands Used and Their Purpose
    Command:
      nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
      This is a host discovery (ping scan) command that checks which devices are active on the network.
      It scans the entire subnet (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255) but does not check for open ports.
      The -sn option tells Nmap not to perform a port scan—only to detect live hosts.

    Purpose:
      This command scans the entire network (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255) to find active devices. 
      It does not check for open ports but simply lists the devices connected to the network.
    
    Result:
      Found active devices on the network, meaning some computers or devices responded.
      Identified IP addresses assigned to various devices.
      Detailed Port Scan


    Command:
      nmap -p- 192.168.0.136
      This command performs a full port scan on the target device 192.168.0.136.
      The -p- option tells Nmap to scan all 65,535 ports (from 0 to 65535) instead of just the default 1,000 ports.

      Purpose: This command scans all possible ports (0-65535) on a specific device (192.168.0.136) to check which ones are open and might be used for communication.

    Result:
      Identified open ports, which could indicate services running on the device.
      Some ports might be vulnerable if they are improperly secured.

    Vulnerability Scan (Service Detection)
    Command:
      nmap -sV --script=vuln 192.168.0.136
      This command performs service version detection and vulnerability scanning on the target 192.168.0.136.
      It helps identify which services are running and checks for known vulnerabilities
      
      Purpose: This command detects which services are running on the open ports and checks for known vulnerabilities.

    Result:
      Found specific services running on open ports.
      Checked for common vulnerabilities in these services.
      If any vulnerable service is detected, it means it could be exploited by attackers.
      NetBIOS and SMB Enumeration


    Command:
      nmap -p 137,138,139,445 --script=smb-os-discovery,smb-enum-shares,smb-enum-users 192.168.0.136
      This command scans NetBIOS (137-139) and SMB (445) ports to gather information about file-sharing services and the operating system of the target (192.168.0.136).
      It checks for shared folders, user accounts, and OS details

      Purpose: This scans NetBIOS and SMB-related ports to enumerate shared resources and user accounts.

      Result:
        Identified shared folders and services running on SMB.
        Enumerated user accounts if permissions allowed.
        Checked for potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in file-sharing settings.
      Live Packet Capture

      command:
        sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.0.136 -vv
        sudo → Runs the command with root privileges (required for packet capture).
        tcpdump → The command-line tool for network packet analysis.
        -i eth0 → Captures traffic on interface eth0 (main network adapter).
        host 192.168.0.136 → Filters packets only for this specific IP.
        -vv → Increases verbosity, displaying detailed packet information.

        Purpose: This captures and displays live network traffic between the scanning machine and the target device (192.168.0.136) to analyze communication.

      Result:
        Displayed multiple UDP packets related to mDNS (Multicast DNS) and NetBIOS name service.
        Showed requests and responses within the local network.
        No critical vulnerabilities detected in captured packets.

2. Summary of Findings
        Active Devices               : The network scan found multiple active devices.
        Open Ports on 192.168.0.136  : The scan revealed several open ports, which could indicate running services.
        Services Identified          : The vulnerability scan detected the types of services running.
        NetBIOS and SMB Exposure     : Found shared folders and user accounts that might require further security assessment.
        Potential Vulnerabilities    : No critical vulnerabilities were found in the packet capture, but open ports should always be secured.

3. Recommendations
        Close Unused Ports       : Any unnecessary open ports should be closed to prevent unauthorized access.
        Update Software          : Ensure all detected services are up-to-date to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
        Restrict SMB and NetBIOS : Limit access to SMB and NetBIOS services, especially for publicly accessible networks.
        Use Firewalls            : A firewall can help control which connections are allowed.
        Monitor Traffi c         : Regularly checking network traffic can help detect suspicious activity early.

Conclusion: 
        This scan provided valuable insights into the network security status. 
        While no immediate threats were found, securing open ports, restricting unnecessary file-sharing services, 
        and monitoring the network continuously is recommended to prevent potential attacks.
