Target: zero.webappsecurity.com

1. Executive Summary
  A comprehensive scan of zero.webappsecurity.com revealed multiple critical
  vulnerabilities, including outdated SSL/TLS configurations, denial-of-service
  (DoS) risks, and exposed admin panels. Immediate remediation is required to
  prevent exploitation.

Key Findings:
    - 3 Critical Vulnerabilities (Slowloris, POODLE, CCS Injection).
    - Expired SSL Certificate (Expired in 2022).
    - Apache Tomcat server with default paths (/admin/, /manager/html).
    - Weak Encryption (SSLv2, RC4 ciphers.

2. Scan Details
    Command 1: Basic Port Scan
    Command: nmap -sS -p- -T4 zero.webappsecurity.com
  Findings:
    Port 80: HTTP Open (Web server)
    Port 443: HTTPS Open (Expired SSL certificate)
    Port 8080: HTTP-proxy Open (Possible admin interface)
    Port 113: Ident Closed (No service running)

3. Vulnerability Scan
    Critical Vulnerabilities:
      - CVE-2007-6750 (Slowloris DoS) - High Risk (Server crash via open connections)
      - CVE-2014-3566 (POODLE SSLv3) - High Risk (Data decryption)
      - CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection) - High Risk (Man-in-the-middle attacks)
Other Observations:
      - TRACE method enabled (XSS risk).
      - Admin panels exposed: /admin/, /manager/html (401 Unauthorized).

4. Risk Assessment
      Risk Level     Count     Examples
        High           3       POODLE, Slowloris, CCS Injection
       Medium          2       Weak DH, TRACE method
        Low            1       Exposed admin panels

5. Recommendations
    Urgent Actions:
      - Renew SSL certificate and disable SSLv2/SSLv3.
      - Patch Apache to fix CVE-2011-3192 and CVE-2007-6750.
    Security Hardening:
      - Disable TRACE method.
      - Restrict access to /admin/ and /manager/html/.
    Monitoring:
      - Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block DoS attempts.

6. Conclusion
      The server is highly vulnerable to attacks due to outdated software and weak
      encryption. Immediate patching and configuration changes are required to
      mitigate risks.
